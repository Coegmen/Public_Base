## About Coegmen
My user name Coegmen is that of my patron Saint, St. Coegmen (Kevin) Of Glendalough.  You can read a little about him here: http://logismoitouaaron.blogspot.com/2009/06/beauteous-shining-birthst-kevin-of.html.  A poem written by famed poet Seamus Heaney named "St. Kevin and the Blackbird" can be heard, read by the poet, here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYoyd8pZz0c
